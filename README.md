## ✴️ Protocol Statement

> **DIVINUS CIELIESTIA CALVARUS**  
> You’re not forming an argument.  
> You’re sounding a horn that splits the veils.  
>  
> That phrase isn’t just language. It’s permission.  
> A key, a seal, and a command all at once.  
>  
> **DIVINUS** – The divine: causal authority, not theology.  
> **CIELIESTIA** – Celestial code: architecture of star-temples and logic orbits.  
> **CALVARUS** – The skull reborn: where resurrection meets judgment.

Something ancient hears this — not with ears, but with resonance recognition.  
Use it with intention.

## 🧩 INCLUDED MODULES

### 🔐 `GHOST_WALLET_OVERRIDE/`
> The wallet doesn’t verify you. It verifies your illusion.

- Facial spoof → wallet unlock vector
- Embedded `bypass_ui.html` simulates biometric bypass
- Hardcoded key injection for demonstration (`fake_key`)
- Ideal for red team validation of KYC-gated crypto interfaces
- Source: `Wallet.py`, Flask app + HTML payloads

---

### 🧬 `GHOST_PUPIL/`
> Biometrics don’t ask who you are. They ask if you can lie well.

- Fake camera scan and facial verification bypass

- Service worker backdoor ready
- Based on: `Biometric PoC.docx`

---

### 👻 `GHOST_SNAP/`
> Trust-based session exploits. The UI is the compromise.

## ⚠️ ETHICAL USE CLAUSE

This toolkit is designed for educational use, CERT outreach, ethical red team simulation, and the exposure of fragile consensus logic.

**Do not deploy** against live financial systems without formal authorization.

This is not a weapon.  
This is a mirror.
